# 🗓️ Calendar App

A **user-friendly calendar web application** built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [Day.js](https://day.js.org/). The Calendar App displays events in a clean monthly grid, making it simple to view upcoming tasks and schedules — inspired by Google Calendar, with static event integration.
